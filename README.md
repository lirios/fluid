Fluid is a collection of cross-platform QtQuick components for building fluid and dynamic applications,
using the [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) guidelines.

Online documentation is available at [liri.io](https://liri.io/docs/sdk/fluid/develop/).

## Dependencies

Qt >= 5.8.0 with at least the following modules is required:

 * [qtbase](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git)
 * [qtdeclarative](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtdeclarative.git)
 * [qtquickcontrols2](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtquickcontrols2.git)
 * [qtgraphicaleffects](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtgraphicaleffects.git)
 * [qtsvg](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtsvg.git)
 * [qtdoc](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtdoc.git)

Only for Linux builds:

 * [qtwayland](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtwayland.git)

## Build

Qbs is a new build system that is much easier to use compared to qmake or CMake.

If you want to learn more, please read the [Qbs manual](http://doc.qt.io/qbs/index.html),
especially the [setup guide](http://doc.qt.io/qbs/configuring.html) and how to install artifacts
from the [installation guide](http://doc.qt.io/qbs/installing-files.html).

Open up `fluid.qbs` with QtCreator, hit build and run to see the demo in action.

Alternatively you can build it yourself from the terminal.
We strongly advise against manual builds, unless you have previous experience.

**Qbs does not currently support Android builds**, please use per-project installation
if you are building a mobile app.

From the root of the repository, run:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
qbs setup-toolchains --type gcc /usr/bin/g++ gcc
qbs setup-qt /usr/bin/qmake-qt5 qt5
qbs config profiles.qt5.baseProfile gcc
qbs -d build profile:qt5
```

You can also append the following options to the last line:

 * `project.withDemo:false`: Do not build the demo app.
 * `project.withDocumentation:false`: Do not build the documentation.
 * `project.useStaticAnalyzer:true` to enable the Clang static analyzer.

Run the demo with (unless `project.withDemo:false`):

```sh
qbs run --no-build -d build --products fluid-demo
```

### Documentation

The HTML documentation is built if `project.withDocumentation:true` is passed
to qbs and it is localed inside `<install root>/share/doc/fluid/html`.

Open `<install root>/share/doc/fluid/html/index.html` with a browser to read it.

## Installation

You can either install system-wide or per-project installation which
is essentially embedding Fluid in your project.

System-wide installations are usually performed by packagers who want
to redistribute Fluid in their Linux distro.

Per-project installation is most useful for mobile developers that
want to build Fluid alongside their project.

## System-wide installation

We assume that your distro installs QtQuick modules in `/usr/lib/qt/qml`
like `Arch Linux` does, please change the paths for your Linux distro.

The same goes for other operating systems.

From the root of the repository, run:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
qbs setup-toolchains --type gcc /usr/bin/g++ gcc
qbs setup-qt /usr/bin/qmake-qt5 qt5
qbs config profiles.qt5.baseProfile gcc
qbs build --no-install -d build profile:qt5 qbs.installRoot:/ qbs.installPrefix:usr modules.lirideployment.qmlDir:lib/qt/qml
sudo qbs install -d build --no-build -v --install-root / profile:qt5
```

Please note that a system-wide installation is discouraged in most cases
because there's a risk to "pollute" your system with libraries not
managed by a package manager.

## Per-project installation

You can embed Fluid in your project and build it along your app.

We have an example with qmake in `examples/perproject/minimalqmake`
and another one for qbs in `examples/perproject/minimalqbs`.
