    \qmltype SmoothFadeImage
    \inqmlmodule Fluid.Controls 1.0
    \ingroup ui
    \brief Displays an image and smoothly fade when the source is changed.

    This component can be used in place of an Image when a smooth fade animation
    between two sources is needed.

    When the source is changed and the fade animation ends, the image loaded before
    is unloaded; this means that only one image at a time is loaded.

    Images are loaded asynchronously and are not cache, so unlike the Image
    component the \c asynchronous and \c cache properties are not available.

    Example of usage:
    \code
    import QtQuick 2.0
    import Fluid.Controls 1.0

    Item {
        width: 128
        height: 128

        SmoothFadeImage {
            anchors.fill: parent
            source: "http://www.maui-project.org/images/logos/m.png"
            fillMode: Image.PreserveAspectFit
            smooth: true
            fadeDuration: 400

            MouseArea {
                anchors.fill: parent
                onClicked: parent.source = "http://www.maui-project.org/images/logos/qt.png"
            }
        }
    }
    \endcode
*/
Item {
    id: root

    /*!
        The image being displayed.
        SmoothFadeImage can handle any image format supported by Qt, loaded
        from any URL scheme supported by Qt.

        \sa Image::source
    */
    property url source

    /*!
        \qmlproperty enumeration fillMode

        Set this property to define what happens when the source image has a
        different size than the item.

        \list
          \li Image.Stretch - the image is scaled to fit (default)
          \li Image.PreserveAspectFit - the image is scaled uniformly to fit without cropping
          \li Image.PreserveAspectCrop - the image is scaled uniformly to fill, cropping if necessary
          \li Image.Tile - the image is duplicated horizontally and vertically
          \li Image.TileVertically - the image is stretched horizontally and tiled vertically
          \li Image.TileHorizontally - the image is stretched vertically and tiled horizontally
          \li Image.Pad - the image is not transformed
        \endlist

        Defaults to \c Image.Stretch.

        Note that \c clip is false by default which means that the item might
        paint outside its bounding rectangle even if the fillMode is set to PreserveAspectCrop.
    */
    property int fillMode : Image.Stretch

    /*!
        Set this to change the fade animation time (in milliseconds).
        Default value is 250 ms.
    */
    property int fadeDuration: 250

    /*!
        This property holds whether the fade animation is running or not.
    */
    readonly property bool running: animation.running

    /*!
        Set this property to false to disable the fade animation.
        If the animation is disable, SmoothFadeImage behaves like a normal Image.

        The fade animation is enabled by default.
    */
    property bool animationEnabled: true

    /*!
        This property holds the actual width and height of the loaded image.

        Unlike the \c width and \c height properties, which scale the painting of the
        image, this property sets the actual number of pixels stored for the
        loaded image so that large images do not use more memory than necessary.

        For example, this ensures the image in memory is no larger than
        1024x1024 pixels, regardless of the SmoothFadeImage's width and height values:

        \code
            Rectangle {
                width: ...
                height: ...

                Image {
                    anchors.fill: parent
                    source: "reallyBigImage.jpg"
                    sourceSize.width: 1024
                    sourceSize.height: 1024
                }
            }
        \endcode

        If the image's actual size is larger than the sourceSize, the image is
        scaled down. If only one dimension of the size is set to greater than 0,
        the other dimension is set in proportion to preserve the source image's
        aspect ratio. (The \c fillMode is independent of this.)

        If both the sourceSize.width and sourceSize.height are set the image
        will be scaled down to fit within the specified size, maintaining the
        image's aspect ratio. The actual size of the image after scaling is
        available via \c Item::implicitWidth and \c Item::implicitHeight.

        If the source is an intrinsically scalable image (eg. SVG), this property
        determines the size of the loaded image regardless of intrinsic size.
        Avoid changing this property dynamically; rendering an SVG is slow compared
        to an image.

        If the source is a non-scalable image (eg. JPEG), the loaded image will be
        no greater than this property specifies. For some formats (currently only
        JPEG), the whole image will never actually be loaded into memory.

        sourceSize can be cleared to the natural size of the image by setting
        sourceSize to undefined.

        Note: Changing this property dynamically causes the image source to be
        reloaded, potentially even from the network, if it is not in the disk cache.

          \li Image.Ready - the image has been loaded
          \li Image.Loading - the image is currently being loaded
          \li Image.Error - an error occurred while loading the image
        \endlist

        This property holds whether the image is smoothly filtered when scaled or
        transformed. Smooth filtering gives better visual quality, but it may be
        slower on some hardware.

        visual or performance effect.

        By default, this property is set to \c true.
