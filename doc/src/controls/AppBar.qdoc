*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty Action AppBar::leftAction

    The back action to display to the left of the title in the action bar.
    When used with a page, this will pick up the page's back action, which
    by default is a back arrow when there is a page behind the current page
    on the page stack. However, you can customize this, for example, to show
    a navigation drawer at the root of your app.

    When using an action bar in a page, set the \l Page::leftAction instead of
    directly setting this property.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty list<Action> AppBar::actions

    A list of actions to show in the action bar. These actions will be shown
    anchored to the right, and will overflow if there are more than the
    maximum number of actions as defined in \l maxActionCount.

    When used with a page, the actions will be set to the page's \l Page::actions
    property, so set that instead of changing this directly.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int AppBar::elevation

    The elevation of the action bar. Set to 0 if you want have a header or some
    other view below the action bar that you want to appear as part of the action bar.

/*!
    \qmlproperty color AppBar::decorationColor

    The background color of the window decoration when the AppBar's page is active,
    usually a darker version of \l backgroundColor.
    By default this is the primary color defined in \l Material.primaryColor with a
    shade of \l Material.Shade700.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int AppBar::maxActionCount

    The maximum number of actions that can be displayed before they spill over
    into a drop-down menu. When using an action bar with a page, this inherits
    from the global \l AppToolBar::maxActionCount. If you are using an action bar
    for custom purposes outside of a toolbar, this defaults to \c 3.

    Set to \c 0 if you don't want to overflow actions.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string AppBar::title

    The title displayed in the action bar. When used in a page, the title will
    be set to the title of the page, so set the \l Page::title property instead
    of changing this directly.
